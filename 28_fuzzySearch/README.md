## Fuzzy Search

Build a search engine that takes in a search word (a string) and looks through a list (an array of strings) and returns another list of "fuzzy" matches to the search word. Fuzzy search means that there is a tolerance of one character being incorrect. For example, a search of "Jesz" would return "Jess". 

```var names = ["mike", "dave", "jack", "marry", "jim", "jill", "june", "jess", "grey", "greg", "mark", "derrek", "richard", "robert"]```
